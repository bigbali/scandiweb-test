Hello. This is a step on the road to getting hired. Yay :)
So, as required, this is pure React and JS, with a bit of TypeScript as sauce (because I had to try TS!).
As you can probably see, this app, if we can call it that, came together in 3 months time.
That is mostly because I had a busy summer, but I also mismanaged my time a bit, so I take responsibility.
I believe I made many mistakes juniors typically make, but at least I got an opportunity to learn something
(and I do intend to learn, very much so!). I'd like to be more than a code printer, which means there's a long way to go.
Truth be told, there is still some stuff to do, but I couldn't really make sense of the design at some places,
so I guess either this gets me an interview or you tell me what I need to work on.

Down to the technical stuff:


*BUGS AND UNFINISHED STUFF*
- In MinicartItem component, you can select a combination of variation attributes that doesn't exist, so there won't be a quantity indicator
- If you navigate to the page of a product that doesn't exist, it will take you to the last item you visited
    (a 404 used to yell at you instead). Not necessarily a bug though. Actually, you can't navigate through products by only using URLs.
